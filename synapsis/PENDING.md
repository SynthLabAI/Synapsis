## Pending documentation changes

### Incorrect
- curr_diff is not defined in the MACD example page code, don't exactly know how to fix

### Needed
- Alpaca `get_clock` in the exchange class
- Paper trade enable/disable watchdog in the exchange class
- Alpaca also has a weird orderbook
- Changes in the homogeneity of the websocket trade feeds
- Go over features page again because got so many features
- Backtest result class
- Say something about how get_account will try to get the base asset
- Add .time to both Strategy and StrategyState and explain how the time change to match during backtesting
- Add `deque` as an option to `.history` in `return_as`
- Add the functions from the live_var export off
