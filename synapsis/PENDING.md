## Pending documentation changes

### Incorrect
- curr_diff is not defined in the MACD example page code, don't exactly know how to fix

### Needed
- Alpaca `get_clock` in the exchange class
- Alpaca also has a weird orderbook
- Changes in the homogeneity of the websocket trade feeds
- Go over features page again because got so many features
- Backtest result class
- Say something about how get_account will try to get the base asset
