        Create a new signal.

        This heavily differs from Strategy objects. While a Strategy is optimized for the implementation of
         short or long-term trading strategies, a Signal is optimized for long-term monitoring & reporting of many
         symbols. Signals are designed to be scheduled to run over intervals of days & weeks. When deployed live,
         a signal-based script will only start when scheduled, then exit entirely.

        Args:
            exchange: An exchange object to construct the signal on
            evaluator: The function that can take information about a signal & classify that signal based on parameters
            symbols: A list of symbols to run on.
            init: Optional setup code to run when the program starts
            teardown: Optional teardown code to run before the program finishes
            formatter: Optional formatting function that pretties the results form the evaluator
