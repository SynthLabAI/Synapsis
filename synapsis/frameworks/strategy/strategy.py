        Turn this strategy into a backtest.

        Args:
            ** We expect either an initial_value (in USD) or a dictionary of initial values, we also expect
            either `to` to be set or `start_date` and `end_date` **

            to (str): Declare an amount of time before now to backtest from: ex: '5y' or '10h'
            initial_values (dict): Dictionary of initial value sizes (i.e { 'BTC': 3, 'USD': 5650}).
                Using this will override the values that are currently on your exchange.
            start_date (str): Override argument "to" by specifying a start date such as "03/06/2018". This can also
                be an epoch time as a float or int.
            end_date (str): End the backtest at a date such as "03/06/2018". This can also be an epoch type as a float
                or int
            save (bool): Save the price data references to the data required for the backtest as well as
                overriden settings.
            settings_path (str): Path to the backtest.json file.
            callbacks (list of callables): Custom functions that will be run at the end of the backtest

            Keyword Arguments:
                **Use these to override parameters in the backtest.json file**

                use_price: str = 'close',
                    Set which price column to use.

                smooth_prices: bool = False,
                    Create linear connections between downloaded prices

                GUI_output: bool = True,
                    Enable/disable GUI webpage display after backtest

                show_tickers_with_zero_delta: bool = False,
                    Exclude tickers that have no change to account value in the GUI

                save_initial_account_value: bool = True,
                    Put an extra frame which contains the initial account values before any trade

                show_progress_during_backtest: bool = True,
                    Show a progress bar as the backtest runs

                cache_location: str = './price_caches'
                    Set a location for the price cache csv's to be written to

                continuous_caching: bool
                    Utilize the advanced price caching system built into the backtest. Automatically aggregate and prune
                    downloaded data.

                resample_account_value_for_metrics: str or bool = '1d' or False
                    Because backtest data can be input at a variety of resolutions, account value often needs to be
                        recalculated at consistent intervals for use in metrics & indicators.
                        This setting allows the specification of that consistent interval.
                        The value can be set to `False` to skip any recalculation.

                quote_account_value_in: str = 'USD'
                    Manually set what valuation should be used when calculating account value.
                        Multiple types of quote currency (ex: USD and EUR) are not supported because
                        there is no datasource for quoting pairs such as EUR-USD until forex integration.

                ignore_user_exceptions: bool = True
                    Set this to True to handle user exceptions identically to how they're handled by strategy calls.
                        False means that the backtest will immediately stop & attempt to generate a report if something
                        in the user calls goes wrong. True will replicate strategy errors.

                risk_free_return_rate: float = 0.0
                    Set this to be the theoretical rate of return with no risk
